# Leaking GTAlgo

I am releasing the source code of "GTAlgo," a script used by the notorious scammer, Zachary Belloto, also known by his aliases "GTGuy" and "GTTrader." Operating out of New York, Belloto managed to deceive hundreds of individuals, promising to double their money through his fraudulent scheme.

Belloto's modus operandi involved gaining the trust of his victims by selling them a script that allegedly guaranteed profits. After delivering the script, he would convince them to send him money for "doubling," only to disappear with the funds. Through this deceitful tactic, he scammed thousands of dollars from unsuspecting individuals.

In an effort to bring justice and prevent further scams, I infiltrated his operations, gained his trust, and acquired several screenshots of his scamming activities, along with the source code of his so-called algorithm, GTAlgo. I reported Belloto to the appropriate authorities and informed his family members of his fraudulent activities.

By releasing this script, I aim to expose the tools and tactics used by scammers like Belloto, raising awareness and protecting potential victims from falling into similar traps.
